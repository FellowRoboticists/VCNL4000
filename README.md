VCNL4000 Proximity Sensor Arduino Library
=========================================

This project contains the definition of an Arduino library for the VCNL4000
sensor. This sensor is able to perform relatively short (< 7 inches) proximity
sensing and light intensity readings.

The commands for the sensor are such that you can read proximity readings
independenty of ambient light levels.
